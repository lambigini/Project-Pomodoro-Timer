# Project-Pomodoro-Timer
- Implemented a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks
- Set the focus duration
- Set the break duration
- When the user clicks the "play" button, the timer starts
- When the focus time expires, an alarm plays and then the break timer starts
- When the break time expires, the alarm plays again and then the focus timer starts
